<h1>Norman Dunbar's GitHub Pages</h1>
<p>If you are here, something unexpected has probably happened. Did you click "Home" on one of my GitHub Pages web sites?
   If so, it appears that GitHub adds a "Home" link which takes you to here, rather than to the home page of the inividual web sites.</p>
   
<p>This is a small price to pay for what is effectively, free hosting. However, panic not! You can get back to where you were by clicking a link below. Thanks for visiting.</p>
